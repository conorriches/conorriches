    This is an brief but eclectic mix of some of my projects.<br/><br/>
    I work as a software engineer but here on my personal repo you'll find some of the interesting bits I've been working on. Not all of what I do makes it online, and not all of that is public!<br/><br/>
    I'm a member of Hackspace Manchester and it's here I do all sorts of making, coding and hacking of stuff.
