With someone knowledgable neaby, I found out about ENIG - using gold on the front of the board which could be used to make a beautiful effect.</p>\n<p>I made a rough first design, and when this was checked over (turns out I'd shorted out a few bits, this would have made the battery become a small heater) and sorted out, we were ready to go ahead and get a small batch made by Elecrow.</p>\n<p>We soldered some up, and they worked!

I know I defined a success as making our money back, and wouldn't be upset if there wasn't really the interest.</p>\n<p>We were agreed that we could go as low as £3 if we had to, so with a cash float, boxes of leaflets and promotional stuff for the space (as well as projects and a monitor showing a slideshow), we packed our stuff, and headed for Newcastle.</p>\n<h2>The event</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"Teaching soldering with custom designed PCBee","featuredImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/pcbees/"}},
